;;; General UX

;; A simple confirmation prompt when killing Emacs. But only prompt when there
;; are real buffers open.
(setq confirm-kill-emacs #'doom-quit-p)
;; Prompt for confirmation when deleting a non-empty frame; a last line of
;; defense against accidental loss of work.
(global-set-key [remap delete-frame] #'doom/delete-frame-with-prompt)

;; Don't prompt for confirmation when we create a new file or buffer (assume the
;; user knows what they're doing).
(setq confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer nil)

(setq uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward
      ;; no beeping or blinking please
      ring-bell-function #'ignore
      visible-bell nil)

;; middle-click paste at point, not at click
(setq mouse-yank-at-point t)

;; Larger column width for function name in profiler reports
(after! profiler
  (setf (caar profiler-report-cpu-line-format) 80
        (caar profiler-report-memory-line-format) 80))


;;
;;; Scrolling

(setq hscroll-margin 2
      hscroll-step 1
      ;; Emacs spends too much effort recentering the screen if you scroll the
      ;; cursor more than N lines past window edges (where N is the settings of
      ;; `scroll-conservatively'). This is especially slow in larger files
      ;; during large-scale scrolling commands. If kept over 100, the window is
      ;; never automatically recentered. The default (0) triggers this too
      ;; aggressively, so I've set it to 10 to recenter if scrolling too far
      ;; off-screen.
      scroll-conservatively 10
      scroll-margin 0
      scroll-preserve-screen-position t
      ;; Reduce cursor lag by a tiny bit by not auto-adjusting `window-vscroll'
      ;; for tall lines.
      auto-window-vscroll nil
      ;; mouse
      mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(2 ((shift) . hscroll))
      mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal 2)


;;
;;; Cursor

;; The blinking cursor is distracting, but also interferes with cursor settings
;; in some minor modes that try to change it buffer-locally (like treemacs) and
;; can cause freezing for folks (esp on macOS) with customized & color cursors.
(blink-cursor-mode -1)

;; Don't blink the paren matching the one at point, it's too distracting.
(setq blink-matching-paren nil)

;; Don't stretch the cursor to fit wide characters, it is disorienting,
;; especially for tabs.
(setq x-stretch-cursor nil)


;;
;;; Buffers



;;
;;; Fringes

;; Reduce the clutter in the fringes; we'd like to reserve that space for more
;; useful information, like git-gutter and flycheck.
(setq indicate-buffer-boundaries nil
      indicate-empty-lines nil)


;;
;;; Windows/frames

;; A simple frame title
(setq frame-title-format '("%b – Doom Emacs")
      icon-title-format frame-title-format)

;; Don't resize the frames in steps; it looks weird, especially in tiling window
;; managers, where it can leave unseemly gaps.
(setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)

;; But do not resize windows pixelwise, this can cause crashes in some cases
;; when resizing too many windows at once or rapidly.
(setq window-resize-pixelwise nil)

;; UX: GUIs are inconsistent across systems, desktop environments, and themes,
;;   and don't match the look of Emacs. They also impose inconsistent shortcut
;;   key paradigms. I'd rather Emacs be responsible for prompting.
(setq use-dialog-box nil)
(when (bound-and-true-p tooltip-mode)
  (tooltip-mode -1))

;; FIX: The native border "consumes" a pixel of the fringe on righter-most
;;   splits, `window-divider' does not. Available since Emacs 25.1.
(setq window-divider-default-places t
      window-divider-default-bottom-width 1
      window-divider-default-right-width 1)

;; UX: Favor vertical splits over horizontal ones. Monitors are trending toward
;;   wide, rather than tall.
(setq split-width-threshold 160
      split-height-threshold nil)


;;
;;; Minibuffer

;; Allow for minibuffer-ception. Sometimes we need another minibuffer command
;; while we're in the minibuffer.
(setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)

;; Show current key-sequence in minibuffer ala 'set showcmd' in vim. Any
;; feedback after typing is better UX than no feedback at all.
(setq echo-keystrokes 0.02)

;; Expand the minibuffer to fit multi-line text displayed in the echo-area. This
;; doesn't look too great with direnv, however...
(setq resize-mini-windows 'grow-only)

;; Typing yes/no is obnoxious when y/n will do
(if (boundp 'use-short-answers)
    (setq use-short-answers t)
  ;; DEPRECATED: Remove when we drop 27.x support
  (advice-add #'yes-or-no-p :override #'y-or-n-p))
